# Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone http://github.com/swasun/LibUnknownEchoUtilsModule
```

Build in release mode:
```bash
mkdir -p build/release
cmake -Bbuild/release -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd build/release
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Or build in debug mode:
```bash
mkdir -p build/debug
cmake -Bbuild/debug -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cd build/debug
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

* By default, dependencies are built and install in the `build` directoy.
To specify an other path, add `-DLIBEI_INSTALL=/usr` flag in `cmake` command.

* To build with LIBEI already installed in the system, add `-DLIBEI_SYSTEM=TRUE` flag in `cmake` command.

* Alternatively, you can build using `build_release.<sh|bat>` and `build_debug.<sh|bat>` scripts.

Finally, to install in the system:
```bash
cd build/release
<sudo> cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

# Examples

Some examples are available in `examples` directory.

```bash
./bin/release/examples/progress_bar_example
```

# Basic usage

The following `basic_usage.c` is an example of a simple usage of the library (file available in `examples` directory):
```c
#include <ueum/ueum.h> /* include LibUnknownEchoUtilsModule */
#include <ei/ei.h> /* include LibErrorInterceptor */

int main() {
    char *data;

    ei_init(); /* initialize LibErrorInterceptor */

    /* use LibUnknownEchoUtilsModule */

    /* return the content of the file */
    data = ueum_read_file("test.txt");

    /* free data only if it's allocated */
    ueum_safe_free(data);

    /**
     * If the file test.txt doesn't exist or cannot be
     * opened, libueum will used libei to record an error
     * in the stacktrace of the current thread.
     * If so, we can print the stacktrace.
     */
    if (ei_stacktrace_is_filled()) {
        ei_stacktrace_print_all();
    }

    ei_uninit(); /* uninitialize LibErrorInterceptor */

    return 0;
}
```

Compile statically:
```bash
gcc -o basic_usage basic_usage.c -lueum_static -lei_static -pthread
```

*note*: `-pthread` flag is necessary for Unix.

# Dependency

* [LibErrorInterceptor](https://github.com/swasun/LibErrorInterceptor), a lightweight and cross-plateform library to handle stacktrace and logging in C99.

# Architecture

## Facade design pattern
The facade design pattern is use to simplify the complexity of a module.
In the module, we have 2 to 4 sub folders which are:
* api: that contains the highest level of functions/structs of the module.
* impl: that contains implementation(s) a api files.
* factory (optional): that contains factories to create complex objects from the api files.
* utils (optional): that contains utils functions only used in this module.

# Cross-plateform

Successfully tested on the following OS (on both 32 and 64 bits):
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Windows 10
